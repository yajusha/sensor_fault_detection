# sensor_fault_detection
 ## Overview  This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting faults in sensor data. The goal of this project is to develop a robust and reliable system that can automatically identify anomalies or faults in sensor readings, enabling timely intervention and maintenance.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Anomaly Detection Models**: Implementation of various machine learning models specialized in detecting sensor faults, including but not limited to Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoders.
- **Model Evaluation and Comparison**: Rigorous evaluation metrics and visualizations to compare the performance of different models.
- **Deployment Ready**: The trained model(s) can be easily deployed in a production environment for real-time sensor fault detection.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains sample datasets and preprocessing scripts.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Trained models saved in a serialized format for easy deployment.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model implementation.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation, if any, explaining specific aspects of the project.
